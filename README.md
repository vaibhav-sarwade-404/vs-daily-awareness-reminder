# vs-daily-awareness-reminder
This app allows you to create your daily awareness reminder on scheduled or random basis. And remind you to be in present moment and remind you that you are enlightened.

### 1. Core Objective
- The app should remind users to return to the present moment. Each reminder should feel like a gentle nudge back to awareness, not an imposition.
- Incorporate beautiful visuals and affirmations that align with mindfulness practices, using imagery and words to help shift users' focus to the present.

### 2. Types of Reminders
#### A. Mindfulness Triggers

    Sensory Awareness: Remind users to tune into their senses, like sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell.
        Example: “What can you hear right now? Tune into the sound around you.”
        Image: Peaceful outdoor nature scene, like a forest or beach.
    Breath Awareness: Gently guide users back to their breath.
        Example: “Pause. Take a deep breath. Feel the air entering and leaving your body.”
        Image: Serene image of a calm river or the sky with clouds moving.
    Body Awareness: Encouraging users to check in with their body.
        Example: “Notice how your body feels. Are you holding tension anywhere? Let it go.”
        Image: An image of someone meditating or a gentle stretch in nature.

#### B. Perspective Shifts

    The Dream Perspective: Remind the user that everything is part of the "dream" of life.
        Example: “What if this moment is just a dream? How would you feel if you weren’t so attached to the outcome?”
        Image: Surreal art or dreamlike imagery, such as clouds blending into a landscape.
    Non-Attachment: Focus on being a detached observer.
        Example: “Watch your thoughts without attachment. Notice them like clouds passing in the sky.”
        Image: A peaceful sky with drifting clouds or birds in flight.
    Unity with All: Encourage seeing everyone as reflections of the self.
        Example: “The person next to you is just another version of you. How can you love them as yourself?”
        Image: Diverse faces representing unity or an interconnected pattern (e.g., flowers, leaves, or interconnected circles).

#### C. Wisdom Reminders

    "You Are Already Enlightened": Remind the user of the truth of their innate nature.
        Example: “You don’t need to do anything to be enlightened. You are already here.”
        Image: A lightbulb turning on, symbolizing an “aha!” moment, or a calm meditating figure surrounded by light.
    Letting Go of Striving: Remind the user that enlightenment cannot be forced.
        Example: “You don’t need to force enlightenment. It happens naturally, like a flower blooming.”
        Image: A time-lapse of a flower blossoming or a peaceful sunrise.

### 3. How Frequently Should the Reminders Be?
### Frequency

    Personal Customization: Allow users to control how frequently they want reminders, since everyone’s needs are different.
        Light reminders: Once every hour or two (for more mindful users or beginners).
        Gentle nudges: Several times a day (2–4 reminders spread out, for users looking for regular guidance).
    Gradual Frequency: Over time, the reminders could decrease as users become more self-aware and integrate the practices into their routine. But it’s essential to allow the user to manually adjust it, as their needs may change.

### B. Options for Scheduling

    Custom Time Intervals: Allow users to set their own schedule for reminders, with the option to choose specific times or intervals (e.g., “every 2 hours,” “morning and evening,” etc.).
    Personalized Experience: Provide a feature to select different categories of reminders for different times of the day, for instance:
        Morning: Reminders about gratitude, setting the intention for the day.
        Afternoon: Mindfulness of work, focus, or calming stress.
        Evening: Reflective reminders, letting go, and gratitude practice.

### C. Gradual Nudges or Deep Dives

    Reminder Length: Keep reminders short and sweet. A single line with a powerful message can do a lot. Longer reminders could be for specific times of day or more profound reflections, which the user can opt into.


### Visuals: Images & Design

Beautiful visuals are critical for reinforcing the message and creating a calming, aesthetic experience. Here are some ideas for the imagery to accompany each reminder:

    Nature scenes (sunsets, rivers, trees, clouds, oceans, mountains) to evoke a sense of peace and presence.
    Surreal or dreamlike imagery (subtle, abstract art or scenes that evoke a sense of wonder, like soft light or reflections) to reflect the idea of life being a "dream."
    Minimalistic design: Keep the interface clean and soothing, with soft pastel colors or earth tones to prevent distraction.



### TO-do
[] On reminder user can see "Detachment, look at 5 things around you and think this is enough for me in this moment". Whole point is letting go of future thoughts and be present in the moment.
[] On reminder user can see "Pause and notice this moment. Breathe. Be here now."
[] On opening app you can see "I don’t need to do anything. This moment, as it is, is enough." message with pictures.
[] Design so that user knows that this is for shifting your mindset, this is just to live current moment and not for thinking of the future like "I’m doing this to get enlightened,".
